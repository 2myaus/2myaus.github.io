why do peoples play rock paper scissors
its a stupid stupid game
it does not work
the logic is really not right
if you are a rock
  and you are fighting scissors
i understand it
rock you're winning
scissor good luck
you can now not cut other things
  because rock has crushed you good
if you are scissor
paper coming around the corner
and looking at a
looking at a nice street sign or what
bye bye
you know
you are now origami swan
  or something
good job scissor
but
if you are paper
  and you see some rock
you do this
what
what is this
you like a hat
this does not hurt a rock
this help a rock
this is a positive
  relation
symbiotic here

no more with this
this is stupid
rock paper dynamite
right
